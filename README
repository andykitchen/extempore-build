This project builds a relocatable binary distribution of extempore.

To kick everything off run:

$ ./all.sh

Most of the scripts should be self explanatory. They just
automate building and copying in a reasonably straight forward way.
They should be basically what you would type in the terminal if you
were doing it manually.

The output will be in the directory ./usr

The magic of making the binary build relocatable is using
the @rpath linker magic of dyld. See copy-prebuild.sh and copy-postbuild.sh
for more details.
